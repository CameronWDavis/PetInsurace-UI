# Pet Insurance App

This is the final project for HCI, it presents an interface for a site that makes it easier to buy pet insurance. 

Such a site doesn't currently exist and so users are left to discover which will be their best option through trial and error for each site and becoming familiar with disparate policies.

## Installation and Running
